# Dedication

This book, with its provocative tone and unwavering commitment to ethical leadership, is dedicated to my father, who passed away at 91, just five months ago. He was a complex man - a giant upon whose shoulders I stand, who taught me the true meaning of propriety, fairness, and uprightness, often through unconventional means.

My father was not a man of endless patience. He could be sarcastic, even provocative. He had a knack for challenging people, pushing them out of their comfort zones. Yet, beneath this exterior lay a heart of gold and a mind sharp as a tack.

He cared for others with a depth that often surprised those around him. I remember him bringing a homeless person into our home, intent on providing a new jacket and a warm bath - actions that spoke louder than words ever could.

His sense of civic duty was strong, but he preferred direct action to political maneuvering. He was a man of results, not empty promises.

In his later years, despite his own comfort, he chose to dine at community kitchens - not out of need, but out of a desire to bridge social divides and demonstrate the equality of all people.

Even in death, he showed his foresight and care. Everything was meticulously arranged, a final act of responsibility and love for those he left behind.

In a letter I was to read after his passing, he wrote: "My son, you are a lightning star. Your intellect is far beyond mine and most other people. You can take my word for it." These words, a mix of pride and challenge, epitomize the man he was - always pushing, always believing in the potential for greatness.

This book's tone - direct, sometimes provocative, always striving for ethical clarity - is a tribute to my father's approach to life and leadership. It's an attempt to capture the essence of a man who understood that ethical leadership isn't about being perfect, but about striving consistently for what's right, even when it's uncomfortable or unpopular.

To my father, whose ethical compass always pointed true north, even when his words might ruffle feathers. Your lessons in propriety, fairness, and uprightness, delivered with wit and occasionally a sting, form the foundation of this work, and of my life.

Thank you, Dad, for showing me what it truly means to be an ethical leader - complex, challenging, but always true to one's principles.
