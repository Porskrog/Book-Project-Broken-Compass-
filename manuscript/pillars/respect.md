# Respect: The Virtue You Lose by Trying to Earn

Think you're respectful because you say "please" and "thank you"? Congratulations, you've mastered kindergarten-level ethics. Real respect, the kind that forms the bedrock of true leadership, isn't about politeness. It's about having the guts to be honest when it hurts.

## The Respect Trap

Here's a mind-bender for you: The more you try to be respectful, the less respectful you become. Why? Because you're not respecting the other person's intelligence. You're infantilizing them, assuming they can't handle the truth.

Remember that manager who gave vague, positive feedback to avoid hurting feelings? They weren't being respectful. They were being a coward, denying their team the opportunity to grow.

Or that CEO who kept quiet about impending layoffs to "maintain morale"? That's not respect. That's manipulation, pure and simple.

Real respect is tough. It's telling an employee they're underperforming. It's admitting to stakeholders that a project is off track. It's disagreeing with your boss when they're wrong.

## The Antifragile Respect Strategy

1. Brutal Honesty: Respect people enough to tell them the truth, even when it's uncomfortable. Sugar-coating isn't respect; it's condescension.

2. High Expectations: Set the bar high. Expecting less from someone because of their background or circumstances? That's not respect; it's soft bigotry.

3. Allowing Failure: Let people fail. Swooping in to save them isn't respect; it's robbing them of growth opportunities.

4. Embracing Conflict: Foster healthy disagreement. A team that never argues is a team that never innovates. Real respect means valuing diverse opinions, not enforcing artificial harmony.

## The Respect Paradox

Here's where it gets interesting: True respect often looks like its opposite. Let's break it down:

1. Challenging Ideas: Respecting someone's idea doesn't mean agreeing with it. It means taking it seriously enough to critique it rigorously.

2. Giving Tough Assignments: Handing someone an impossible task isn't setting them up for failure. It's showing you believe they're capable of the extraordinary.

3. Allowing Consequences: Shielding people from the results of their actions isn't respect. It's infantilization. Real respect means allowing people to experience the full weight of their choices.

4. Saying No: Constantly saying yes isn't respect. It's people-pleasing. Respect means being willing to disappoint people in the short term for their long-term benefit.

## The Empathy Angle

Now, I can hear the objections. "But what about being kind and understanding? Isn't that part of respect?"

Sure, empathy is crucial. But here's the kicker: Most leaders use "empathy" as an excuse for cowardice. They avoid tough conversations under the guise of being "understanding." That's not empathy; that's abdication of leadership.

Real empathy in respect means:

1. Understanding someone's perspective, but not necessarily agreeing with it.
2. Acknowledging emotions, but not being ruled by them.
3. Considering circumstances, but not using them as excuses for lower standards.

## Real-World Example: The Respectful Rebel

Meet Alex, a CTO I once worked with. His team called him "The Respectful Rebel." Why? Because he respected his team enough to rebel against corporate BS.

When upper management pushed for an unrealistic deadline, Alex pushed back - hard. "I respect my team too much to set them up for failure," he said in a board meeting. "And I respect this company too much to deliver a half-baked product."

The board was furious. But Alex's team? They would have walked through fire for him. Because he showed them real respect - not by being nice, but by being honest and fighting for their best interests.

## The Respect Equation

Respect = (Truth-telling x High Standards) / Comfort

If your respect isn't making someone uncomfortable occasionally, it's not real respect. It's just platitudes.

## The EQ Twist

Let's bring Emotional Intelligence into the respect game:

- Self-Awareness: Recognize when your "respect" is actually fear of conflict or desire for approval.
- Self-Regulation: Control your impulse to soften hard truths.
- Motivation: Be driven by long-term growth, not short-term comfort.
- Empathy: Use it to understand how to deliver tough messages effectively, not to avoid delivering them.
- Social Skills: Use them to build relationships strong enough to withstand honesty and conflict.

## The Fine Line: Respect vs. Rudeness

There's a fine line between honest respect and outright rudeness. Here's how to walk it:

1. Intention Matters: Your tough truths should come from a place of genuine respect and desire for the other person's growth. If you're being harsh out of anger or ego, you've crossed the line.

2. Timing and Setting: There's a time and place for everything. Criticizing someone in public isn't respect; it's humiliation. Choose your moments wisely.

3. Offer Solutions: Pointing out problems without offering potential solutions isn't respect; it's complaining. Always couple critique with constructive suggestions.

4. Listen Actively: Respect is a two-way street. If you're doing all the talking, you're not respecting the other person's voice.

5. Acknowledge Effort: Recognizing someone's effort (even if the result falls short) isn't coddling; it's fair. Couple it with honest feedback for best results.

## The Antifragile Respect Challenge

Ready to stop being a respect poser and start being a beacon of real respect? Try these:

1. The Truth Bomb: Identify one truth you've been avoiding telling. Tell it today, respectfully but without sugar-coating.

2. The Standard Elevator: Raise your standards for someone you've been underestimating. Tell them why you're doing it.

3. The Constructive Conflict: Find a colleague you always agree with. Actively look for something to respectfully disagree about.

4. The Failure Allow: Let someone on your team fail at something (safely). Then help them learn from it.

5. The Respect Reciprocity: Ask for brutally honest feedback about your performance. Thank the person for respecting you enough to be honest.

## The Respectful Leader's Manifesto

1. I respect you enough to tell you the truth, even when it's uncomfortable.
2. I respect you enough to hold you to high standards.
3. I respect you enough to let you fail and learn.
4. I respect you enough to disagree with you openly.
5. I respect you enough to put long-term growth over short-term comfort.

## The Long-Term View

Here's the ultimate test of your respectful leadership: Do people seek you out for honest feedback, even when it hurts? If yes, you're doing it right. If they're avoiding you or only coming to you for validation, you've failed at real respect.

Remember: Respect isn't about making people feel good. It's about helping them be good. It's about creating resilient, capable individuals who can handle the truth and use it to grow.

Are you ready to stop confusing politeness with respect and start truly respecting your team, your peers, and yourself? The choice is yours. But choose quickly â€“ in a world of yes-men and sycophants, real respect is a rare and valuable commodity.

## Reflection Questions

1. Think of a time when someone respected you enough to tell you a hard truth. How did it impact you?
2. What's the most difficult truth you need to tell someone out of respect? What's holding you back?
3. How might your desire to be seen as "respectful" be holding back your team or organization?
4. In what ways can you raise your standards to show more respect for your team's capabilities?
5. How would your leadership change if you optimized for long-term growth and resilience rather than short-term harmony?

The path of true respect in leadership is challenging and often misunderstood. But it's the only path that leads to real growth, both for you and those you lead. Are you respectful enough to take it?
