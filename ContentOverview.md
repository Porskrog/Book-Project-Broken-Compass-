# The Broken Compass: A Guide to Ethical Leadership

## Book Overview

### Purpose:
"The Broken Compass" focuses on the individual leader's ethical journey in an increasingly complex world. Through provocative examples and personal case studies, the book exposes how our ethical decision-making often fails us, not because we lack moral values, but because our internal compass is misaligned or broken.

The timing is critical. As leaders face unprecedented pressures from technological advancement, organizational complexity, and societal changes, the need for strong ethical leadership has never been greater. Yet, many leaders find their traditional approaches to ethical decision-making inadequate for today's challenges.

Drawing from real-world scenarios—like Sarah, a program manager whose reliance on technical expertise blinds her to true leadership responsibilities—the book demonstrates how easily our ethical compass can be thrown off course, and more importantly, how to recalibrate it.

### Target Audience:

- Struggle with ethical decisions in complex situations
